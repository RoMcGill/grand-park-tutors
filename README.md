Design

-   Colour Scheme

-   The color scheme used is black,white and alice blue for great contrast and readability. Imagery was used to add extra pops of color and interest to the basic palette.

-   Typography

-   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate. It is also familiar and widely used. This gives the user a feeling of familiarity and trust towards the site.

-   Imagery

-   The imagery used was purposely chosen sized and positioned to convey a sense of professionalism, and trustworthiness without being dry or boring, the imagery used conveys fun, and is fit for purpose intended, the images used to represent each genre are fun but accurate representations of each genre which promote a positive emotional response.

The animation for the character images to make them bounce is another key to provoking a positive emotional response. The act of bouncing or jumping up and down has been a response to happiness and excitement for years. This will subconsciously give the user a positive emotional response.

When the site is viewed on a mobile device the imagery for the  genre links (the characters) hover over the nav bar at the top of the screen. This was intentional and also a catch 22. Following best practice rules for ux it is unusual and untypical to have this happen

 using the z-index the character hovers over the nav bar when scrolling through the sections. This was implemented intentionally and serves a purpose, that purpose being that when the user is scrolling through that section of the page their attention is kept to that specific section. This was done to avoid any distraction and lead to a user clicking away before they found what they are looking for. It also adds a refreshing design element that may interest or excite the user.
