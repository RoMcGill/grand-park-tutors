            <p>
                Hiphop is a style of music which came into existence in the United States during the mid- 1970s, and became a large part of modern pop culture during the 1980s. It consists of two main components: rapping and DJing.

                <p>This was the first song to tell, with hip-hop’s rhythmic and vocal force, the truth about modern life in inner-city America.</p>
                <p>Over seven minutes, atop a Seventies P-Funk jam, rapper Melle Mel and co-writer Duke Bootee, a member of the Sugar Hill Records house band, traded lines and scenes of struggle and decay,</p>
                <p>with a warning at the end of each verse:<strong>“Don’t push me ’cause I’m close to the edge/I’m trying not to lose my head.”</strong>

        <div id="songs-text-2"><h3 id="song-title">Sugarhill Gang, "Rapper's Delight"</h3> <div id=song-content> <p> Robinson got the idea for the song while watching a DJ talk over a record in a Harlem club, and she formed the Sugarhill Gang shortly thereafter.</p>
            <p>On the original 12-inch single, “Rapper’s Delight” was 15 minutes of urban-playboy bragging over a disco-rhythm track that blatantly quoted the bass line in Chic’s 1979 hit “Good Times.”</p>
            <p> Chip Shearin, who played bass guitar at the “Rapper’s Delight” session, recalled “sweating bullets” as he played the song’s body-moving lick, without changes or mistakes, for a quarter-hour.

            <p> “I wasn’t afraid to rap about school being cool,” Darryl “DMC” McDaniels said years later.<strong> “That was empowering.</strong>

        <div id="songs-text-4"><h3 id="song-title">Geto Boys, "Mind Playing Tricks on Me"</h3> <div id=song-content>
            <p>Shortly before the Geto Boys released their 1991 album, We Can’t Be Stopped, the Houston trio’s diminutive member Bushwick Bill was shot in the eye during a suicidal freakout.</p>
            <p> He survived; a photo of him displaying his wound appeared on the album’s cover.</p>
            <p> This Top 30 hit, recorded before but issued after the incident, revealed even more of the manic depression and death wish deep inside the Geto Boys’ violent, misogynist rhymes.</p>
            <p> Scarface, who wrote and produced the track sounded like his movie namesake: hopped-up and fully armed at the edge of sanity,</p>
            <p>over dark-treble guitar and a gunslinger-walk rhythm sampled from Isaac Hayes’ soundtrack to the 1974 film Three Tough Guys. In a genre where fear was not thought manly, “Mind Playing Tricks on Me” was a classic of cracked ghetto armor and bloody surrender: <strong> that even the hardest of the hard have worried hearts.</strong>
