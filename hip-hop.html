            Hip hop or hip-hop is a culture and art movement that was created by African Americans, Latino Americans and Caribbean Americans in the Bronx, New York City. The origin of the name is often disputed. It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx. While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music including rap, hip hop is characterized by four key elements: "rapping", a rhythmic vocal rhyming style, DJing and turntablism
