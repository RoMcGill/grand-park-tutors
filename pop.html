        <div id="songs-text-1"><h3> 'Gives You Hell' by The All-American Rejects</h3><div id=song-content>
            <p>- Release year: 2008, Despite its upbeat sound, this power-pop hit by the All-American Rejects explores some relatively dark subject matter.</p>
            <p> According to frontman Tyson Ritter, the song takes a tongue-in-cheek approach toward “looking at someone you hate...and giving them the finger.” </p>
            <p>In addition to grabbing the #1 spot on the U.S. Pop charts, it landed at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100,<strong> where it became the first song with the word "hell" in its title to crack the top 10</strong>

        <div id="songs-text-2"><h3>'I Knew You Were Trouble' by Taylor Swift</h3><div id=song-content>
            <p>- Release year: 2012, Taylor Swift continued to stray from her country roots to forge a broader pop aesthetic.</p>
            <p> Putting that newfound sensibility on full display was this hit single from her wildly successful album, “Red.” With its palpable dubstep influence,</p>
            <p>the song sees Swift experimenting in terms of sound and style, but sticking close to familiar subject matter. Specifically, the song is about a break-up, albeit one that Swift saw coming from a mile away.

        <div id="songs-text-4"><h3>Because Of You' by Kelly Clarkson</h3><div id=song-content>
            <p>- Release year: 2004 To think, there was actually a time when “American Idol” winners went on to enjoy successful careers in the music business.</p>
            <p>For proof, look no further than season one champion Kelly Clarkson, with her 2004 hit single, “Because of You.”</p>
            <p>Clarkson later describe the song as the “most depressing one [she's] ever written”.</p>
            <p> Similarly depressing was the adjoining music video, which depicts Clarkson as a housewife who's in a bitter argument with her husband.
